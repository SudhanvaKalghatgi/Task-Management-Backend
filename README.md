 Task Management System – Backend

A production-ready backend API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for managing tasks, users, assignments, priorities, and workflow progress.
This backend follows a clean, modular structure with controllers, models, routes, middleware, and environment configuration — making it scalable and easy to extend.
